# DAP - Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors


This repository contains the software implementation for the algorithm of Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors (DAP), which is specifically designed for mapping multiple QTLs while incorporating genomic annotations. In addition, we also provide source code, scripts and necessary data for various numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the DAP algorithm. 


## Repository directories

* ``src``: the source code of the core DAP algorithm implemented in C++, can be compiled as a standalone algoirthm

* ``EM_dap1``: a C++ implementation of DAP-1 embedded EM algorithm

* ``experiments``: this directory contains necessary scripts/code and data for evaluating the DAP, e.g., performance comparison with the MCMC, exact Bayesian calculation etc.
