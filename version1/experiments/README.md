This directory contains scripts/code and simulated data for evaluating the DAP for the manuscript, e.g., performance comparison with the MCMC, exact Bayesian calculation etc. 

Note, some of the code has become obsolete, i.e., better code has been implemented in either torus or dap. This particular directory is setup mostly for documentation/reproduciblility purpose.
