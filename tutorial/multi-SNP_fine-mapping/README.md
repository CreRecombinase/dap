# Multi-SNP Fine-mapping Analysis

It is important to note that multi-SNP fine-mapping analysis should be performed for each locus, all the data files should be organized for each locus separately before running the analysis.

## Input Data Format

### Genotype-Phenotype Data File (Required)

This data file contains individual-level phenotype and genotype information required by genetic association analysis, and in plain text format. The data file allows information multiple subgroups (e.g. in a meta-analytic setting). Importantly, each data file for multi-SNP fine-mapping analysis should (ideally) be corresponding to a single locus.

The phenotype section contains lines starting with the keyword "pheno". Each line has the following format
```
  pheno  pheno_id subgroup_id pheno_ind_1 pheno_ind_2 ... pheno_ind_n
```  
The pheno\_id field contains a character string that denotes the name of the phenotype. The group\_id field is a character string that uniquely labels a specific group. Note that the group IDs should be consistently used in the data file. The following entries are numerical values of phenotypes for individual 1 to _n_ in the indicated subgroup. Note, because each subgroup can have different number of individuals, the length of each line can differs.

  
The genotype section directly follows the phenotype section. Each line contains the genotype information of a SNP for the samples in a subgroup, i.e.,
```
  geno snp_id  group_id geno_ind_1 geno_ind_2 ... geno_ind_n
```
The leading "geno" is a keyword that indicates the line encodes genotypes. The snp\_id field contains a character string that denotes the ID of a SNP. The additional group_id field indicates the particular subgroup in which genotypes are measured. The remaining entries are genotypes of the target SNP for individual 1 to _n_ in the subgroup coded in dosage format (i.e, 0,1 or 2, or any fractional numbers between [0,2] if the genotype is imputed). 

Note that if the data only contains a single group, the group\_id becomes nuisance. Nevertheless, it is still required.

Missing values in phenotype and genotype data are allowed, and they should be represented by "NA".




### Effect Size Grid File (Required)

The grid file contains information on prior effect size specifications for causal variants. In the fine-mapping analysis, the effect size of each causal variant is treated as a nuisance parameter and integrated out. In our model, the effect size is defined on the scale of signal-noise ratio, and therefore unit-less. For the general meta-analytic setting, two (hyper-)parameters, phi and omega, are required: phi represents the heterogeneity of a genetic effect across multiple subgroups, and omega describes the average effect size. For commonly-used fixed-effect meta-analysis, simply specify phi=0. Alternatively, omega^2/(omega^2 + phi^2) represents the correlation of effects between subgroups, and (omega^2 + phi^2) represents the overall genetic effect which can be linked to heritability (for a SNP with frequency f, the hertiability explained by the single SNP association is roughly 2\*f\*(1-f)\*(omega^2+phi^2)/[1+2\*f\*(1-f)\*(omega^2+phi^2)]. In practice, we use a grid of (phi, omega) combinations to describe the long-tail behavior of the genetic effects observed in practice. If the data only contains a single study, only omega needs to be specified and phi can be conveniently set to 0. The mathematical details on the effect size prior specification can be found in [Wen and Stephens, 2014](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1396966283) and [Flutre et al,2013](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003486). 

The grid file contains a two-column data matrix: the first column  specifies phi and the second column specifies omega the average effect size (hyper)-parameter (omega). Each row of the grid data matrix provides a unique combination. A sample grid file for fixed-effect meta-analysis is given below.    

```
0.0000  0.1000
0.0000  0.2000
0.0000  0.4000
0.0000  0.8000
0.0000  1.6000
```

The [sample file](sample_data/grid) used in cross-population cis-eQTL analysis allows some effect size heterogeneity for eQTLs across population groups. 


### Prior File (Optional)

The prior file specifies SNP-level prior for each candidate SNP. This file is optional, if not specified, the analysis assumes that prior for each SNP is 1/p, where p is the number of candidate SNPs in the locus. Note that, this default prior implies that the prior expected number of causal SNPs is 1 in the locus. For loci identified in the QTL discovery step, this default prior is likely conservative. Nevertheless, we highly recommend that users specify the SNP-level priors, especially when relevant genomic annotations are used, and their enrichment levels are quantified in the enrichment analysis step.

The prior file takes the following simple format
```
chr6.6488577  3.033e-04
chr6.6488581  3.033e-04
chr6.6488609  3.033e-04
chr6.6488817  3.033e-04
chr6.6488818  3.033e-04
chr6.6489565  2.575e-04
chr6.6489624  2.575e-04
chr6.6489755  2.575e-04
chr6.6489774  2.575e-04
```
The first column represents the SNP name and the second column represents the prior probability that the SNP is associated. 


#### Automatic Prior Computation by TORUS

The SNP-level priors can be computed by the executable ```torus``` in the process of enrichment analysis. Essentially, the prior is computed using an empirical Bayes approach by plugging in the point estimate of the enrichment parameters. Use the command-line option "_dump\_prior_ direcotory_name" in either enrichment or QTL discovery analysis. Once the option specified, ```torus``` outputs prior files for each locus in the specified directory. e.g.,   
```
torus -d geuv.summary.bf.gz --load_bf -smap geuv.snp.map.gz -gmap geuv.gene.map.gz -annot geuv.annot.gz  -est -dump_prior gene_prior > geuv.enrichment.est
```
### Running Multi-SNP Fine-mapping Analysis


Running multi-SNP fine-mapping analysis requires binary executable ```dap```. To start the analysis, type the following command 
``` 
dap -d ENSG00000112799.dat -g grid -t 8 -it 0.05 > ENSG0000112799.fm.rst
```

#### Important Command-line Options

The minimum required command-line options for running the analysis are "-d" (followed by phenotype-genotype data file name) and "-g" (followed by grid file name). Other options are all optional, however important for efficient computation. Here are some options are particularly important for efficiency:

* ```-t thread_number```: specify number of parallel threads in computation. Using parallel processing can greatly improve the efficiency of the fine-mapping analysis, DAP is implemented using OpenMP library and can take advantage of multi-thread computation. Because of the computational intensity, we strongly recommend running DAP in a multi-core environment. By default, the thread\_number is set to 1.

* ```-it inclusion_threshold```: the inclusion\_threshold is a parameter that DAP algorithm used to screen marginally or conditionally noteworthy candidate SNPs. It is defined in a probability scale ranging from 0 to 1. If it is set to 0, DAP regards all candidate SNPs as noteworthy, and the DAP carries out the exact calculation (without approximation), which is computationally most expensive and typically not desired; when it is set to a relatively large value, e.g., 0.25, the behavior of the DAP becomes similar to commonly applied conditional analysis, which is fast but does not fully account for LD or explore the model space. The default value is set to 0.01. However if a locus contains large number of SNPs and/or the LD pattern within a locus is complicated, the running time could be long.  in such cases, we recommend to set a modest inclusion\_threshold at 0.05, with which we observe very insignificant precision loss (comparing to the default 0.01 value)
