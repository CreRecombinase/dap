# Utilities for DAP-G


## Construction of Bayesian credible sets

Usage:

```
perl get_credible_set.pl  -d dapg_output_file [-p confidence_prob]
```

Parameter ``confidence_prob`` is a fractional number in (0,1). By default, it sets to 0.95, i.e., a 95% credible set will be constructed for each qualifying signal cluster.
