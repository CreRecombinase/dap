# DAP-1 embedded EM algorithm for enrichment analysis

This direcotory contains the source code for integrative enrichment analysis of QTL data using the DAP-1 algorithm. Although the exact functionality can be achieved using the [script](https://github.com/xqwen/dap/blob/master/experiments/enrichment/em_fmap.pl) with the ``dap`` executable, we provide this C++ implementation for much improved computational efficiency. The project is still under active development.
